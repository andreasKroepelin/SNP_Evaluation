# SNP Evaluation

This tool lets you have a deeper look at your sequenced (bacterial) genomes.

The idea is that you load a VCF file as well as a SNP Table and then choose from a wide range of possibilities what properties of the SNPs you are interested in. This tool then gives you the opportunity to explore these properties in detail.

The SNP Table can be obtained by using the [Multi VCF Analyzer](https://github.com/alexherbig/MultiVCFAnalyzer).
